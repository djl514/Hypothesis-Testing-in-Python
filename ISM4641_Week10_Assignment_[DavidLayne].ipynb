        "In this assignment, you will build upon last week’s analysis of TechTrends—our fictional e-commerce company—and use the same datasets to answer business questions with hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation. You will work with the following datasets:\n",
        "\n",
        "- sales-data.csv: Monthly sales and marketing data for 2023 and 2024.\n",
        "- product-performance.csv: Performance metrics for various product categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Learning Objectives\n",
        "By completing this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to: - Formulate and test statistical hypotheses based on business data. - Use one-sample, two-sample, and paired t‑tests to compare means. - Compute and interpret 95% confidence intervals. - Apply these statistical methods to real-world business scenarios, supporting decision-making for TechTrends.\n",
